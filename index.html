          >THE STORY OF THE
          <h2>KAYI TRIBE</h2></span
        >
        <p>
          Set in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), the nomadic Kayi tribe of the
          Oghuz Turks are on a quest to find a place they can finally call home.
          Ertugrul, the leader of the tribe, leads his people through
          perseverance against hardship while striving for justice and
          maintaining the traditions of the land. By battling his enemies with
          strength and bravery, Ertugrul consequently plants the seed that would
          lead to the founding of the Ottoman Empire, which spread across three
          continents and ruled for six centuries.

            Ertugrul and his friends encounter the Knights Templar on a hunt.
            After rescuing three Seljuk prisoners, they return to the Kayi
            tribe. But the new arrivals cause problems for the tribe's leader
            Suleyman Shah. He dispatches Ertugrul on a mission to find new land
            and seek an agreement with the Sultan in Aleppo.

            Ertugrul is captured by the Mongols. After escaping, his return to
            the tribe creates internal strife with his cousin Tugtekin.
            Meanwhile, Ertugrul's long-lost brother appears. The Kayi tribe
            splits as Ertugrul and a group journey to West Anatolia, leaving the

            The Cavdar tribe, the most powerful in western Anatolia, deal with

            leadership struggle ensues. To strengthen ties, Turgut Alp marries
            Aslihan from the Cavdar. But danger lurks as Emir Sadettin Kopek
